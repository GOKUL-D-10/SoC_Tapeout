Introductory Session on SoC Tapeout Flow
  The introductory session of the SoC Tapeout Program outlined the end-to-end design flow, starting from software development and progressing through hardware design, integration, physical implementation, and finally chip fabrication and testing.

Flow of SoC Tapeout:
  1. C Program Compilation (O0):
    The application is written in C and compiled using GCC.
    Generates the first functional output (O0).
  2. Specification Validation (O1):
    The C model specification is tested and validated.
    Produces the reference output (O1).
  3. RTL Design (O2):
    The hardware is described in RTL (Verilog).
    Verified through RTL architecture to obtain output (O2).
  4. ASIC Design Classification:
    RTL is divided into:
      Processor → synthesized to Gate-Level Netlist (Synth P1). 
      Peripherals → proceed further as:
        a) Macros (Synth RTL)
        b) Analog IPs such as ADC, PLL, and Clock Multiplier (functional RTL).
  5. SoC Integration (O3):
    Processor and peripherals (macros + analog IPs) are integrated via GPIOs.
    The system functions as a microcontroller, producing output (O3).
  6. RTL to GDSII:
    Backend implementation involves:
      i)   Floorplanning
      ii)  Placement
      iii) Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
      iv)  Routing
  7. Tapeout and Fabrication (O4):
    The final GDSII file undergoes DRC and LVS checks before tapeout.
    Chips are fabricated, packaged, connected to boards, and tested with the application software.
    Produces the final validated output (O4).
  8. Application Scope:
    Operating frequency range: 100 Hz – 130 MHz.
    Typical applications: iWatch, Arduino boards, TV panels, and AC systems.

Ultimate Aim:
  The primary objective of the SoC Tapeout flow is to ensure functional equivalence across all stages:
  O0 = O1 = O2 = O3 = O4
  This guarantees that the fabricated chip behaves exactly as intended in the original specification and software model.
